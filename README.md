### Tools Used
Python and its library Pandas

### Skills Demonstrated

  - Standardized `no_show` column to bool ( "YES" â†’ '1' and "NO" â†’ '0')
  - Set numeric columns to proper numeric types.
  - Converted `ScheduledDay` and `AppointmentDay` columns to **datetime**.
- Renamed columns to standardize names.
- Removed rows with unrealistic ages.
